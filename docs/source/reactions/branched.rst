Branched(Wennberg NO + RO2 Reaction)
====================================

Wennberg NO + RO2 reactions are branched reactions with one branch forming
alkoxy radicals plus NO2 and the other forming organic nitrates :cite:`Wennberg2018`.
The rate constants for each branch are based on an Arrhenius rate constant and
a temperature- and structure-dependent branching ratio calculated as:

.. math::

   k_{\text{nitrate}} = (X e^{-Y/T}) \left(\frac{A(T, [\text{M}], n)}{A(T, [\text{M}], n) + Z}\right) 

.. math::

   k_{\text{alkoxy}} = (X e^{-Y/T})\left(\frac{Z}{Z + A(T, [\text{M}], n)}\right) 

.. math::

   A(T, [\text{M}], n) = \frac{2 \times 10^{-22} e^n [\text{M}]}{1 + \frac{2 \times 10^{-22} e^n [\text{M}]}{0.43(T/298)^{-8}}} 0.41^{(1+[\log( \frac{2 \times 10^{-22} e^n [\text{M}]}{0.43(T/298)^{-8}})]^2)^{-1}}

where :math:`T` is temperature :math:`(\mathrm{K})`, :math:`[\mathrm{M}]` is the number density of air :math:`(\mathrm{molecules}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3})`,
:math:`X` and :math:`Y` are Arrhenius parameters for the overall reaction, :math:`n` is the number of
heavy atoms in the RO2 reacting species (excluding the peroxy moiety), and :math:`Z`
is defined as a function of two parameters :math:`(\alpha_0, n)`:

.. math::

   Z(\alpha_0, n) = A(T = 293 K, [M] = 2.45 \times 10^{19} \frac{\text{molec}}{\text{cm}^3}, n) \frac{(1-α_0)}{α_0}

More details can be found in Wennberg et al. (2018) :cite:`Wennberg2018`.

The key-value pairs "reactants," and both sets of "products" are required.
Reactants without a "qty" value are assumed to appear once in the reaction equation.
Products without a specified "yield" are assumed to have a yield of 1.0.

When "X" is not included, it is assumed to be 1.0, when "Y" is not
included, it is assumed to be 0.0 K, when "a0" is not included, it is
assumed to be 1.0, and when "n" is not included, it is assumed to be 0.
The unit for time is assumed to be s, but inclusion of the optional
key-value pair "time unit" = "MIN" can be used to indicate a rate
with min as the time unit.
