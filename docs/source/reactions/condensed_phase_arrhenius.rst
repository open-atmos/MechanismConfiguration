Condensed-Phase Arrhenius Reaction
==================================

Condensed-phase Arrhenius reactions are calculated using an Arrhenius-like rate constant that takes the form:

.. math::

   A e^{-\frac{E_a}{k_bT}} \left(\frac{T}{D}\right)^B (1.0 + E \cdot P)

where:

- :math:`A` is the pre-exponential factor (:math:`[U]^{-(n-1)}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}`),
- :math:`U` is the unit of the reactants and products, which can be :math:`M` for aqueous-phase reactions or :math:`\mathrm{mol\,m}^{-3}` for all other condensed-phase reactions,
- :math:`n` is the number of reactants,
- :math:`E_a` is the activation energy (J),
- :math:`k_b` is the Boltzmann constant (J/K),
- :math:`D` (K), :math:`B` (unitless), and :math:`E` (:math:`\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}`) are reaction parameters,
- :math:`T` is the temperature (K), and :math:`P` is the pressure (Pa).

The first two terms are described in Finlayson-Pitts and Pitts (2000) [Finlayson-Pitts2000]_. The final term is included to accommodate CMAQ EBI solver type 7 rate constants [Gipson]_.

Input data for condensed-phase Arrhenius reactions have the following format:

                    "spec2": { "qty": 2 },
                },

            }

The key-value pairs ``reactants`` and ``products`` are required. Reactants without a ``qty`` value are assumed to appear once in the reaction equation. Products without a specified ``yield`` are assumed to have a yield of 1.0.

Units for the reactants and products must be specified using the key ``units`` and can be either ``M`` or ``mol m-3``. If units of ``M`` are specified, a key-value pair ``aerosol-phase water`` must also be included, whose value is a string specifying the name for water in the aerosol phase.

The unit for time is assumed to be s, but inclusion of the optional key-value pair ``time unit = MIN`` can be used to indicate a rate with minutes as the time unit.

The key-value pair ``aerosol phase`` is required and must specify the name of the aerosol phase in which the reaction occurs.

Optionally, a parameter ``C`` may be included, and is taken to equal :math:`\frac{-E_a}{k_b}`. Note that either ``Ea`` or ``C`` may be included, but not both. When neither ``Ea`` nor ``C`` are included, they are assumed to be 0.0. When ``A`` is not included, it is assumed to be 1.0. When ``D`` is not included, it is assumed to be 300.0 K. When ``B`` is not included, it is assumed to be 0.0. When ``E`` is not included, it is assumed to be 0.0.
